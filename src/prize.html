          to make a modest contribution to the Ghanaian art ecosystem by
          inspiring the next generation of Ghanaian artists to produce work that
          will attract both local and international audiences. It will also draw
          attention to Ghanaian art and encourage increased patronage by the
          middle class and corporate Ghana.
